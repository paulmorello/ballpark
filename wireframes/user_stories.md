#User-Stories

The following user-stories have been developed as an agile method to better
understand users of the site:

##Story 1.
"As a *PARENT*, I want to *SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY*, so I can *RELIVE THE MEMORY*."

##Story 2.
"As a *USER*, I want to *SEE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE GAME*, so I can *VIEW WHAT OTHERS HAVE NOT*."

##Story 3.
"As a *FAN*, I want to *SEE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE FOR ATHLETES*, so I can *BETTER INTERACT WITH MY IDOLS*."

##Story 4.
"As a *SPECTATOR*, I want to *CAPTURE THE MOMENT*, so I can *SHARE THE MOMENT WITH THE WORLD*."
